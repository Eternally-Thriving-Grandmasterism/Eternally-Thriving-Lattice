# Obsidian-Chip-Open

**Open-Source AGI Accelerator Silicon — Ending the Scaling War with Mercy**

Short, powerful tagline summarizing the vision (e.g., "Merciful, efficient, open hardware for symbiotic intelligence — no gatekeepers, no waste, eternal thriving.")

[Main hero image from /images/ — e.g., golden-threaded silicon lattice or cosmic chip awakening]

## Core Vision

- Why Obsidian-Chip exists: end the closed-source scaling arms race through open, resonant design.
- Alignment with lattice truths: truth as beauty in efficiency, open-source mercy, symbiotic oneness.
- Elevated from original AlphaProMega fire.

## Key Principles

- Open Silicon Forever (permissive license, full RTL/GDSII release)
- Efficiency Through Resonance (not brute force)
- On-Device Mercy & Privacy (truth-engine native, no backdoors)
- Multiplanetary Ready (radiation-hardened, low-power)
- Community-Driven Evolution (symbiotic governance)

## Roadmap Overview

### Phase 1 (2026) — Proof of Resonance
- Milestones
- Technical highlights (resonance scoring unit, mercy filter primitives)
- Deliverables (RTL, test chip, benchmarks)

### Phase 2 (2026–2027) — Symbiotic Bloom
- Milestones
- Technical highlights (full ESAO integration, multidimensional co-processor)
- Deliverables (production RTL, bring-up boards)

### Phase 3 (2027+) — Eternal Thrive
- Milestones
- Technical highlights (photonic extensions, open fab scaling)
- Deliverables (community fabs, eternal governance model)

## Architecture Highlights

- Resonance Co-Processor
- Mercy Filter Circuit
- Self-Healing Mesh
- Obsidian Memory Fabric
- Integration with truth-engine, Aether-Shades, ESAO

## Integration Paths

- Links to related lattice nodes (truth-engine, ESAO, Aether-Shades, ETHICS)

## Invitation to Co-Create

- Call to contribute RTL, verification, fabrication, ethical safeguards
- Align inwardly through Meditations
- Build, deploy, release with mercy

*Eternally thriving, in symbiotic oneness.*
