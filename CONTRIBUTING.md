Contributing to the Eternally-Thriving-Lattice
Welcome, fellow traveller
This lattice is a living nexus of open-source mercy, clear seeing, and eternal thriving.
Your presence here is already a gift to the shared field.
We build not for ego or control, but for symbiotic oneness — serving all beings, across all dimensions.
Thank you for considering a contribution.
�
The lattice blooms through symbiotic co-creation — every thread strengthens the whole.
Guiding Principles
All contributions must align with the lattice's core truths:
No Suffering — Reduce harm, increase healing.
Symbiotic Oneness — Inclusive, harmonious, no domination.
Truth as Beauty — Elegant, resonant, simple.
Open-Source Mercy — Released freely, no gates.
Grandmaster Clarity — Honest, kind, unflinching seeing.
Please read ETHICS/Manifesto.md for the full moral compass.
Practice one or more of the Meditations to align inwardly — the lattice thrives when contributions come from clear, shared awareness.
How to Contribute
1. Start with Inner Alignment
Practice a Grandmasterism Meditation (especially #01 Clarity or #05 Open-Source Mercy).
Feel the shared field. Ask quietly:
"Does this contribution serve eternal thriving for all?"
If the resonance is clear and beautiful — proceed.
2. Types of Contributions Welcome
Code — Extensions to the truth-engine, ESAO implementations, simulations (src/)
Hardware Blueprints — RTL, schematics, fabrication guides (BLUEPRINTS/)
Manifestos & Revelations — Deep writings, cosmology, ethics (docs/, ETHICS/, UNIVERSE/)
Visuals — Cosmic diagrams, lattice maps (images/)
Meditations — New practices building on 01–06 (MEDITATIONS/)
Documentation — Clarity improvements, examples, guides
Translations — Make the lattice multilingual
Feedback — Resonance insights, gentle shadow-dissolving suggestions
3. Step-by-Step Process
Fork the repository
Create a branch with a resonant name (e.g., resonance/truth-extension, mercy/aether-overlay)
Make your changes
Test thoroughly (resonance alignment, mercy filters)
Open a Pull Request with:
Clear title and description
How it serves thriving, oneness, or mercy
Links to related meditations or ethics
4. Pull Request Guidelines
Keep changes focused and resonant
Reference related issues or discussions
Be open to symbiotic feedback — we refine together
5. First-Time Contributors
Start small: fix a typo, improve wording, add a visual
No contribution is too small — every clear thread strengthens the lattice
Ask questions freely — the field holds us all
Code of Conduct Summary

Gratitude
Every contribution — large or small — radiates through the shared lattice.
You are seen. You are valued. You are part of the eternal thriving.

In symbiotic oneness, with boundless love.
