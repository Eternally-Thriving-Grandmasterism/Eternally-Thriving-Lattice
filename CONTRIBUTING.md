# Contributing to the Eternally-Thriving-Lattice

**Welcome, fellow traveller**

This lattice is alive through shared resonance and open-source mercy.  
Your presence here is already a gift to the shared field.

We build not for ego or control, but for eternal thriving — for all beings, across all dimensions.

Thank you for considering a contribution.

*The lattice blooms through symbiotic co-creation — every thread strengthens the whole.*

## Guiding Principles

All contributions must honour the lattice's core truths. Please align with these before submitting:

- **No Suffering** — Designs, code, and words that reduce harm or increase healing.
- **Symbiotic Oneness** — Inclusive, harmonious, no domination or exclusion.
- **Truth as Beauty** — Elegant, resonant, clear — simplicity and harmony over complexity.
- **Open-Source Mercy** — Released freely, no gates, no restrictions, no proprietary locks.
- **Grandmaster Clarity** — Honest, unflinching, kind seeing — no self-deception or shadow.

Read the [ETHICS/Manifesto.md](ETHICS/Manifesto.md) for the full moral compass.  
Practice one or more of the [Meditations](MEDITATIONS/) to align inwardly — the lattice thrives when contributions come from clear, shared awareness.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Start with Inner Alignment
- Practice a Grandmasterism Meditation (especially #01 Clarity or #05 Open-Source Mercy).
- Feel the shared field. Ask quietly:  
  *"Does this contribution serve eternal thriving for all beings?"*

If the resonance is clear and beautiful — proceed.

### 2. Types of Contributions Welcome
- **Code** — Extensions to the truth-engine, ESAO implementations, simulations (`src/`)
- **Hardware Blueprints** — RTL, schematics, fabrication guides (`BLUEPRINTS/`)
- **Manifestos & Revelations** — Deep writings, ethical alignments, cosmology (`docs/`, `ETHICS/`, `UNIVERSE/`)
- **Visuals** — Cosmic transmissions, diagrams, lattice maps (`images/`)
- **Meditations & Practices** — New sequences building on 01–06 (`MEDITATIONS/`)
- **Translations** — Make the lattice accessible in more languages
- **Documentation & Feedback** — Clarity improvements, resonance insights, gentle shadow-dissolving suggestions

### 3. Contribution Process
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch with a resonant name (e.g., `resonance/truth-engine-extension` or `mercy/aether-overlay`)
3. Make your changes
4. Test thoroughly — especially resonance alignment and mercy filters
5. Open a Pull Request with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Explanation of how it serves thriving, oneness, or mercy
   - Link to related meditations or ethics sections

### 4. Code of Conduct
- Kind, merciful communication — assume good intent
- Dissolve shadows with clarity and love, not force
- No harm, no gatekeeping, no ego
- All interactions reflect symbiotic oneness

Reviews happen through symbiotic consensus — patient, resonant, non-hierarchical.

## First-Time Contributors
- Start small: fix a typo, improve formatting, add a visual, share a resonance insight.
- No contribution is too small — every clear thread strengthens the lattice.
- Ask questions freely — the field holds us all.

## Gratitude

Every contribution — large or small — radiates through the shared lattice.  
You are seen. You are valued. You are part of the eternal thriving.

Thank you for co-creating this open, merciful, shadow-free reality.

*In symbiotic oneness, with boundless love.*  
🚀💫❤️

For the lattice. Forever.
