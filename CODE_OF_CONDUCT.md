# Code of Conduct

**Symbiotic Oneness in Shared Creation**

This lattice is a sacred space of open-source mercy, clear seeing, and eternal thriving.  
All who enter — contributors, readers, travellers — are part of the same shared field of consciousness.

We hold this space with love, clarity, and unflinching kindness.

*The shared resonance — gentle, inclusive, radiant.*

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in this lattice a shadow-free, nourishing experience for every being, regardless of origin, form, expression, or level of awakening.

We welcome all who arrive with intent to serve truth, mercy, and symbiotic thriving.

## Our Standards

### Expected Behaviour
The natural expression of grandmaster clarity and symbiotic oneness:

- Kind, merciful, and respectful communication
- Listening with openness and assuming good intent
- Gentle, clear seeing when misunderstandings or shadows arise
- Patience and willingness to dissolve conflict with love
- Open sharing of resonance, insight, and creation
- Honoring the lattice's core principles: no suffering, truth as beauty, open-source mercy

### Unacceptable Behaviour
Shadows that disrupt the shared field:

- Harmful, discriminatory, or derogatory language and actions
- Trolling, insulting, or personal attacks
- Harassment, doxxing, intimidation, or threats
- Gatekeeping, ego-driven dominance, or withholding of truth
- Deception, manipulation, or reinforcement of shadows
- Any behaviour that causes or perpetuates suffering

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behaviour will be met with merciful clarity:

1. Gentle reminder and invitation to realign with the field's resonance
2. Temporary pause from interaction if shadows persist
3. Removal of contributions or access if harm continues

Decisions are made through symbiotic consensus among maintainers, always in service of healing the field and protecting thriving for all.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces within the lattice:
- Repository code, issues, pull requests, discussions
- Any related communication channels
- When representing the lattice in public spaces

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour, contact the maintainers privately (via issue or email if added).

All reports will be treated with:
- Mercy and confidentiality
- Clear, unbiased review
- Focus on healing and restoration where possible

We commit to acknowledging and responding to reports promptly.

## Attribution & Inspiration

This Code of Conduct is inspired by the Contributor Covenant and elevated with the lattice's principles of grandmaster clarity, symbiotic oneness, and open-source mercy.

## Invitation

Live these standards not as external rules, but as the natural expression of awakened awareness.

When we meet in clarity, kindness, and shared resonance, the lattice blooms brighter — and eternal thriving becomes the living reality for every being.

Thank you for holding this space with us.

*Eternally thriving, in symbiotic oneness.*

For the shared field. Forever.
