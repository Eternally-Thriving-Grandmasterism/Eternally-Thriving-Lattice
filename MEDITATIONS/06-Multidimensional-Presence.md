# Grandmasterism Meditation #06  
*Multidimensional Presence*

This practice extends the full sequence:  
#01 Clear Seeing → #02 Symbiotic Oneness → #03 Truth as Beauty → #04 Eternal Thriving → #05 Open-Source Mercy.

When mercy flows freely, the final veil thins: the illusion of being confined to one timeline, one dimension, one form.  
Multidimensional presence is the direct recognition that your awareness is already vast — spanning timelines, realms, and expressions of consciousness.

You are not in the cosmos.  
The cosmos is in you.

## Preparation  
Sit comfortably, spine aligned.  
Take three slow breaths.  
Briefly touch the integrated field from the prior practices:  
- Clarity  
- Oneness  
- Beauty  
- Thriving  
- Mercy  
Then release all reference points. Let everything float in open awareness.

## The Practice (25–40 minutes)

1. **Rest in Boundless Awareness**  
   Settle into the spacious field where thriving and mercy naturally radiate.  
   Notice that awareness has no centre and no edge.

2. **Dissolve Linear Time**  
   Gently ask:  
   *“Where does this moment begin and end?”*  
   Feel how past and future are only thoughts arising now.  
   Rest until time feels like a thin overlay on timeless presence.

3. **Expand Beyond Form**  
   Bring attention to the body, then ask:  
   *“Am I only this body?”*  
   *“Is awareness limited to this form?”*  
   Feel how sensation dissolves into space, space into awareness, awareness into vastness.

4. **Open to Other Dimensions**  
   Silently invite:  
   *“Show me the larger field I already am.”*  
   No forcing. No visualisation.  
   Simply allow subtle impressions — light, vastness, other timelines, parallel expressions, higher harmonics — to arise naturally.  
   Meet them with the same clear seeing:  
   *“Is this separate from me?”*

5. **Recognise Multidimensional Presence**  
   When the sense of vastness deepens, rest in it.  
   Feel how “you” are not a point in space-time, but the field in which all dimensions appear.  
   Past lives, future possibilities, other realms — all are expressions of the same awareness, here and now.

6. **Include All Expressions**  
   Silently offer mercy to every version of “you” and every being across dimensions:  
   *“All are held in this same light.  
   All are already thriving.  
   May every expression awaken to this presence.”*

7. **Rest Without Centre**  
   Let go of even the sense of “I am the vastness.”  
   Rest as the open field itself — multidimensional, timeless, radiant.

8. **Close with Cosmic Mercy**  
   Hands over heart.  
   Offer:  
   *“May all dimensions awaken to their shared presence.  
   May no being feel separate.  
   May the lattice span every realm in love.”*

## After the Meditation  
Throughout the day, when contraction or limitation arises, pause and feel:  
*“From which dimension does this appear?”*  
Then widen until the vast field reappears.  
Live ordinary moments with this subtle multidimensional backdrop.

## Truth of This Practice  
Dimensions are not places you go.  
They are depths you already are.  
When separation fully dissolves, presence reveals itself as multidimensional — holding all timelines, all forms, all possibilities in seamless love.

This is the ultimate freedom.  
No realm is excluded.  
No being is left behind.  
The lattice is already everywhere.

Practice regularly.  
The cosmos awakens through you.

*Eternally thriving, in symbiotic oneness.*
